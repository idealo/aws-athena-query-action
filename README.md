## üìã Prerequisites

- [AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)
- [Coreutils - GNU core utilities](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html)

All dependencies are pre-installed in the `ubuntu-*` runner [images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#available-images).

## üöÄ Quick Start

We recommend using [GitHub's OIDC provider](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services) to authenticate with AWS before running this action.

```yaml
name: Run Athena Query
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
  - cron: '0 6 * * *'

jobs:
  athena:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    steps:
    - name: Configure AWS credentials
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v5
      with:
        role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/GitHubActions
        aws-region: eu-central-1
    
    - name: Run Athena Query
      uses: idealo/aws-athena-query-action@v1
      with:
        query-context: Catalog=AwsDataCatalog,Database=myDatabase
        query-string: |

## üîß Configuration

### üì• Inputs

See [action.yml](action.yml) for complete details.

| Name                | Description                                                                | Required | Default   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| `query-id`          | The unique identifier of the saved query.                                  | No       | -         |
| `query-string`      | The SQL query statements to be executed.                                   | No       | -         |
| `query-context`     | The context within which the query executes.                               | Yes      | -         |
| `query-workgroup`   | The workgroup to use for the query.                                        | No       | `primary` |
| `output-location`   | The location in Amazon S3 where your query results are stored.             | Yes      | -         |
| `output-filename`   | The desired name of the file where the query results are stored.           | Yes      | -         |
| `output-min-size`   | The minimum size of the output file (e.g., `1K`, `1M`, `1G`).              | No       | -         |
| `download-location` | The location on the runner machine where the query results are downloaded. | No       | -         |
| `download-filename` | The desired name of the file where the query results are downloaded.       | No       | -         |

### üì§ Outputs

| Name              | Description                                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `query-id`        | The unique identifier of the query execution.                  |
| `output-location` | The location in Amazon S3 where your query results are stored. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### Query Context Format

The `query-context` parameter should follow this format:
```
Catalog=<catalog-name>,Database=<database-name>
```

Example:
```yaml
query-context: Catalog=AwsDataCatalog,Database=my_analytics_db
```

### Output Size Validation

The action validates that query results meet the minimum size requirement specified in `output-min-size`.

Supported formats:
- `1024` (bytes)
- `1K` (1 kilobyte)
- `1M` (1 megabyte) 
- `1G` (1 gigabyte)

### File Management

- Results are automatically moved to your specified filename in S3
- Metadata files are cleaned up automatically
- Failed queries with insufficient output size are cleaned up to prevent storage costs

## üîê Security Best Practices

1. **Use OIDC Authentication**: Prefer GitHub's OIDC provider over long-lived access keys
2. **Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions to your IAM role
3. **Secure S3 Buckets**: Ensure your output S3 buckets have appropriate access controls
4. **Query Validation**: Review SQL queries for potential security issues before execution

### Required AWS Permissions

Your IAM role needs the following permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "athena:StartQueryExecution",
        "athena:GetQueryExecution",
        "athena:GetNamedQuery",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "glue:GetDatabase",
        "glue:GetTable",
        "glue:GetPartitions"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Query Execution Timeout**
- Consider optimizing your SQL query for better performance
- Partition your data to improve query performance

**Insufficient Output Size**
- The action fails if query results are smaller than `output-min-size` (human-readable format)
- Adjust the minimum size requirement or remove it from your configuration to skip this check

**S3 Access Issues**
- Verify IAM permissions for S3 bucket access
- Ensure the S3 bucket exists and is in the correct region

**Authentication Errors**
- Confirm AWS credentials are properly configured
- Check that your IAM role has the required Athena and S3 permissions
